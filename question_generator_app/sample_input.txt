Electricity is a form of energy created by the movement of tiny charged particles called electrons. It can occur naturally, such as in lightning, or be generated artificially through power plants that use coal, gas, water, wind, or sunlight. Electricity powers nearly every aspect of modern life: it lights our homes, runs appliances, fuels industries, and enables global communication. Without it, cities would be dark, machines would stop, and much of daily life would come to a halt. Over time, the discovery and harnessing of electricity have led to inventions such as the light bulb, computers, and the Internet, all of which have transformed human civilization. However, generating electricity can also cause problems, like pollution from fossil fuels or challenges in storing renewable energy. Because of its vital role in human progress and comfort, electricity has become more than just a scientific phenomenon â€” it stands as a symbol of human innovation, power, and the ability to shape the future.
